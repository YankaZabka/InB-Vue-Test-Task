# InB-Vue-Test-Task

You're welcome to [visit](https://inb-vue-test-task.vercel.app/) the deployed project. <br>
Originally, I planned to use the **third version of Vue.js** and the Composition API, but the requirements mentioned the bootstrap-vue library. It doesn't support the third version of Vue (it does, but it's complicated, through a plugin), so I decided to **stick to the requirements** and use **the second version of Vue**. Since the libraries are outdated, this brought an additional challenge to the task, but also some fun! Also, due to the use of old libraries, I decided not to use TypeScript, so as not to make my life completely unbearable.
